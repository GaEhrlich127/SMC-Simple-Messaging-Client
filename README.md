# SMC-Simple-Messaging-Client
A Simple Messaging Client made for my Network Programming final project.

This is my first soiree into Networking for Java, Threading for Java, and my first real use of Swing.
The GUI was designed using the WindowBuilder tool found in the eclipse marketplace, all other noteworthy code was written directly by me.
